Ans1).Difference between Some() and every() is that some() fucntion checks if even a single element satisfies the given
condition and Every() function checks if all the elements satisfy the given condition.

Ans2).Spread operator and rest parameter both are denoted by three dots(...). The difference between both of them 
is the spread operator is used to spread the elements of an array or an iterable object (like a string or another array) into individual elements.
and the Rest parameter allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

Ans3).Difference between splice() and slice() method is splice method is used to modify an array and we can add some element to from whichever index we want
while slice method returns a new array or a copy of the given array or the portion of the array which we have
asked for by giving strating index number and end index number where to stop at.

Ans4).I would strongly prefer splice() method to remove an object from an array instead of filter() because 
splice() method makes it really easy to remove an element form an array by giving index number of what to remove 
and how much to remove. Filter() method is used to perform a given call back function on every element of the array.

Ans5). Difference between Null and Undefined is they both are false when seen as a boolean value but Null is 
a deliberate assignment of no value while Undefined is default value assigned to a variable by javascript that are declared 
but not assigned a value.Null is of type Object while undefined is type of Undefined.
